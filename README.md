# Football Video Analysis

A computer vision project aimed at analyzing football videos to detect and track players, classify teams, recognize jersey numbers, identify key events, and segment the football pitch. This repository demonstrates the integration of YOLO-based object detection models for comprehensive football analytics.In collaboration with [Enock02333](https://github.com/Enock02333) we accomplish this task and are open to discussion and cooperation to make it more comprehensive

## Overview

### Purpose

This project automates the analysis of football game videos using object detection and classification models. It encompasses the following key objectives:

- **Player Detection & Tracking:** Identify and track players across frames.
- **Team Classification:** Classify players into their respective teams.
- **Jersey Number Recognition:** Recognize jersey numbers of players.
- **Event Detection:** Detect specific actions like goals, tackles, or passes.
- **Pitch Detection and Segmentation:** Detect the football pitch and its key points.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Task YOLO Models:** Utilizes YOLOv8-based models fine-tuned for each task.
- **Video Analysis:** Annotates videos with detected objects and events.
- **Comprehensive Outputs:** Provides metrics, graphs, and annotated results.
